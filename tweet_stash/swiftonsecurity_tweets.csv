RT @da_667: @SwiftOnSecurity Easily. Consider how many US security start-ups tout "former NSA" management. __END__
This would easily explain why Israel would see FSB/GRU intelligence gathering directly within Kaspersky network by employees. __END__
So it‚Äôs entirely possible some operations of the company are unknown to parts of its leadership, if the employee base has dual loyalty. __END__

Russia is probably the same way. The workforce synergy between federal computer security and private computer security is probably high. __END__

@Render64 They wouldn‚Äôt have to. But this is a lot easier to keep secret. __END__
Possible Kaspersky both formally gives Russian intel interesting malware data (expected), and infiltrated by them for deeper sweeps. __END__
Antivirus is amazing because not only are you on the system, you are expected to be able to understand all file types, and match signatures. __END__
If I was the FSB/GRU, I‚Äôd mount a long-term infiltration of key posts with the access to implement silent trawls using antivirus parser. __END__
So, Kaspersky has a panopticon for planet Earth. And the Russian government notices this. A few blocks away. Right there. __END__
Modern antivirus is essentially a modern panopticon. It has to be due to the truly incredible venues and methods threats can leverage. __END__
Okay, who‚Äôs ready for an entirely unsourced hot-take on Kaspersky from someone with no evidence or relationships with the company? __END__

I know because I was that student. That young human who believed in an abstract orderly template of how the world worked.  And I was wrong. __END__
Then they are kicked into chaos. A world without design. Or, instead, a world of design with no awareness of future failures sanctioned. __END__
Students, self-taught and institutional, exist in a world of nominal order they think our human universe operates within the parameters of. __END__
What a student does not know is the incredible things that can be achieved in chaos. Humans adapt to chaos. Human systems, sometimes do not. __END__
All failure is impossible in theories of the student. The world could not exist as it is today, merely a facade for the chaos behind it. __END__
This is a view rooted in cleanroom implementations of computer labs, and not the reality of corporate networks that exist to serve thousands __END__
The belief attackers needs to subvert security systems in order to achieve their goals is a false belief in the orderliness of human systems __END__

@breakingcreech Mesuta does not exist. __END__
No one would ever see this monument. No windows. No rest stops for the weary. Just a sealed tube, once again, passing Mesuta by.  The End. __END__
The Hyperloop in Mesuta was redesigned, the sympathetic patterned whine of the Church eliminated. Safety testing was improved nationwide. __END__
5 years later. Governor and victims families finished their speeches, laid wreaths at the monument, and boarded buses back to metropolis. __END__
A Hyperpod from Dallas in the subsection never received a halt command, and slammed into a sealed shutter 2 miles away, killing all onboard. __END__
However, design documents for the Hyperloop safety spool-down never tested for three simultaneously active proximate Hyperline rails. __END__
Although only two lines had been breached, all six airtight emergency shutters in the three proximate Mesuta lines locked closed for safety. __END__
Autonomous systems immediately began pulling down all energized systems in the Mesuta subsection, polling all sensors, preserving analytics. __END__
The breach of two Hyperlines and loss of connectivity to pods raised an Eschelon 1 alarm in Silicon Valley. ‚ÄúDirector, we have a waterfall.‚Äù __END__
A Hyperpod from Houston entered the falling section, shunted downward, killing everyone from blunt force before ripping their bodies apart. __END__
The heavy ferromagnetic metal sled exited the Hyperline Rail 1, turned perpendicular, and shattered the struts for parallel Hyperline Rail 2 __END__
Traveling 300 more feet before destabilizing back and forth, the pod rapidly decelerated, disintegrating and breaching the outside wall. __END__
The Austin Hyperpod travelled through the breach, a hammer of atmospheric air at sea level slamming it against the interior guides. __END__
The explosive could be seen bursting outward in a roar, then immediately plunged back into the vacuum of the tube, its shrapnel peppering. __END__
26 minutes: ‚ÄúPunch it,‚Äù said Jed over the radio. A shaped charged high explosive punctured the Hyperloop Hyperline Rail 1 external sheath. __END__
25 minutes: The Hyperpod from Austin carrying twenty-six passengers entered the Mesuta area Hyperloop subsection at 623 miles per hour. __END__
24 minutes: The two parallel and third intersecting Hyperlines were fully powered - magnetics and vacuum boosters spooling at full load. __END__
An interference pattern in the overlapping magnetics induced the aural vibration, ultimately found benign to long-term system integrity. __END__
Hyperline Mesuta Cross was nicknamed The Church by workers, who during testing noticed an unanticipated resonance in the superstructure. __END__
21 minutes: HVDC interconnects activated, feeding capacitors. Parallel coil whine twinged, pulsing sonic heartbeats through the air. __END__
Dylan woke, looked at the screen, then at Jed, and wordlessly stood. Opening their door to the mid-day sun, he made his way to church. __END__
For days the dutiful program executed its commands, incrementing for patterns. On Sunday, it alarmed. Departure Austin. Trinity: 26 minutes. __END__
Jed laid under a struggling A/C, terminal behind polling Hyperloop API every 5 minutes for departures - algorithm searching for a trinity. __END__
This was a dead place; A forgotten place whose infinite prominence was once assured forever by geography, then ripped away by technology. __END__
Metal and buildings not worth effort to rip them from the ground rusted in Texas sun, shaded periodically only by hazmat haul road trains. __END__
Local jobs laying the Hyperline were real, but low-skilled and ephemeral. Land for pennies, promises for days, monuments to deprecation. __END__
Monied travelers of the metros were already waning in Mesuta, as autonomous vehicle refuel patterns removed arbitrary stops from trips. __END__
Once a successful junction for intrastate travel between Texan megacities, the Hyperloop changed everything, they were told. __END__
Jed and Dylan Hanson were four and six when carrier infrastructure for hyperloop rails were first laid outside their town of Mesuta, Texas. __END__
Nonetheless, as demand for transit drove faster launch intervals at Hyperloop stations, moir√© patterns of mutual line activation emerged. __END__
Utilities didn‚Äôt like the intense draw it put on electrical substations in rural areas, and corporate really didn‚Äôt like waterfalls. __END__
Normally, operators avoided having multiple tubes of the Hyperloop energized at the same transit point. __END__
