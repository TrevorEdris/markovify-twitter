@Twitter hey could you like go 5 tweets back on my TL and change "except" to "accept"? Please don't tell anyone or I WILL kick your ass. __END__
Ok I looked it up and it should be accept but that's not on me, I blame all my terrible teachers and my mom for her bad parenting __END__
Someone who is unable to "except" fault, as in not include fault as something that could happen to them. See, I'm right, and u dumb. __END__
@brodielocks Latrell sprewells account got suspended 😂 __END__
Anybody tweeting me that it's accept and not except is also wrong and a total fucking idiot and probably a dork at school __END__
Now will somebody tell my therapist that since he won't listen to me even though I'm way smarter than him and could probably kick his ass __END__
It's an obvious defense mechanism to deep insecurities. It takes a lot of guts to admit when you're wrong. __END__
People who are unable to except fault or receive criticism usually act very big on the outside but are very small people at the core. __END__
